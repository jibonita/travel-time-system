## Getting Started <a name="gettingStarted"></a>
To get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes you will need to clone the repository into a brand new folder on your machine and navigate to the backend folder and run:
```
npm install
```
Then navigate to frontend folder then navigate to the client folder and run:
```
npm install
```
After all the dependancies are downloaded ensure that you have MariaDB service up and running and create a database named **timetravelsystem**. This can be changed in the config.json file inside the server folder. From the backend folder, you need to enter the db folder and run the following commands to init the database and add the migrations and the seeds:
```
cd db/   (to change to the db folder)
../node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
../node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all
cd ..  (to change back to the root folder)
```
To run the backend server, open git bash from the folder **server**  and use the command:
```
npm run start
```
Now it's time to run the frontend. Navigate to **client** folder and in the terminal use the command:
```
ng serve -o
```
This will open your default browser. The app will be running on port 4200.
Please esnure that both the backend server and the frontend are running.
Voal√°!!
